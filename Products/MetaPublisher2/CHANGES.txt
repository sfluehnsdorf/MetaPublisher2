MetaPublisher2 Changes
======================


Release 2.3.x

Complete rewrite of release 2.2.x. This version, is fully
compatible to earlier releases of MetaPublisher2. 
However, all earlier releases are to be considered obsolete
and are no longer supported. Since it is unlikely there are
any old releases in the public, this should not be a problem
to anyone.

This version redefines and extends the structure of the
application, its plugins and its forms to be more conform
with Zope and Python specifications and style guides, to
provide additional functionality and to be more extensible
and to simplify the creation of new plugins.

Despite a much higher complexity, this release is much more
user friendly through a complete visual makeover. It also
provides a full documentation, online help, tutorials, user
manual and source code documentation.
