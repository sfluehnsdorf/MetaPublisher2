MetaPublisher2 History
======================


Release 2.2.x (obsolete, unreleased)

Complete rewrite of release 2.1.x. This version extended the plugin api while
staying fully backwards compatible. There was a barely announced preview
release to the public, most likely without any downloads.


Release 2.1.x (obsolete, unreleased)

Complete rewrite of release 2.0.x. This version implemented plugin
functionality, multi level tabs and was the first to include a full set of
frontend plugins. This version was the first to be used in a production
environment.


Release 2.0.x (obsolete)

Complete rewrite of release 1.x. This version defined the main structure of
the current MetaPublisher2 system but lacked plugin functionality. This
version was never used in any production environment.


Release 1.x (obsolete, unreleased)

First prototype and proof of concept. This version never did anything
meaningful. It was presented at the beehive Zope BBQ in Berlin on July 12th,
2001. (see <a href="http://www.metapublisher.org/news/20010712/"></a>)
