# MetaPublisher2 Configuration File
# =================================

# The MetaPublisher2 configuration file overwrites the default settings and
# thus allows to customise the application's behaviour. All available options
# understood by the MetaPublisher2 can be found below. Plugins and other
# extensions may define their own configuration options, which can then be
# accessed through MetaPublisher2's Settings API of the System module.

# PLEASE NOTE: After changing any settings, you must restart the Zope server!

# Currently the settings control the following features:
# - Default batch settings: Control the default values for batch lists, such as
#   the number of items per page.
# - URLs: Allows to change the location of the online resources accessed by
#   several of the modules
# - Master Security: All components are grouped in categories which can be
#   controlled through the settings. Each setting accepts one of three values:
#   - protected: will delegate security controls to a Zope permission, making
#     the component accessible from restricted code and possibly through the web
#     (if the called object has a docstring).
#   - private: hides the component's forms and restricts access to its methods
#     to python code.
#   - none: no access, the component is completely disabled.

# The default security settings are somewhat paranoid. All security settings
# controlling components that may be used to transfer data out of a
# MetaPublisher2 or that submit release information to the MetaPublisher
# website. These security settings are set to "none", disabling the component
# For example, if you want to export Entries from a MetaPublisher2, you will
# first have to change the export_entries in the system section to "protected",
# which will delegate security control to the Zope server.

# For more information on how to properly protect your MetaPublisher2 instance
# you may want to refer to the User Manual, accessible through the
# MetaPublisher2 or at the MetaPublisher website at www.metapublisher.org.
